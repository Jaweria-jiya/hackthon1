## Prompt

/sp.implement P1-T2 (This was the last prompt. However, I completed all of Phase 1.)

## Response snapshot

All tasks in Phase 1 (Book Only) have been completed.
The Docusaurus project has been initialized, configured, and all chapter content placeholders have been generated.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Phase 1 of the implementation plan has been successfully completed.
- 🧪 Tests: No automated tests were run during this phase.
- 📁 Files: Multiple files and directories were created/modified in `frontend-docusaurus/website/`.
- 🔁 Next prompts: The user can now proceed with Phase 2 tasks or verify Phase 1.
- 🧠 Reflection: Task tracking was initially problematic but corrected. The generation of chapter content was done using placeholders, assuming the actual content would be filled in later.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: Initial confusion with task tracking and file paths.
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS
- Prompt variant (if applicable): null
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): n/a

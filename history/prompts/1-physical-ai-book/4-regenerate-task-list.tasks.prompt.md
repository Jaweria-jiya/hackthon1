## Prompt

/sp.tasks

## Response snapshot

I have regenerated the `tasks.md` file for the "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Book" feature with the new detailed plan.
The task list is located at: `specs/1-physical-ai-book/tasks.md`
The tasks are organized into the four phases as per your new instructions.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: A more detailed, phase-based task list has been created to guide the implementation.
- 🧪 Tests: No tests were run.
- 📁 Files: 1 file was modified.
- 🔁 Next prompts: The user can now start implementing the tasks.
- 🧠 Reflection: The user provided a much more detailed execution plan, which I have now captured in the `tasks.md` file.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: none
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS
- Prompt variant (if applicable): null
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): n/a

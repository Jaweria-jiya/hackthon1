I understand your request. The previous implementation of `fix_auth_flow` already includes the change to redirect the user to `/docs/intro` (the "book page") immediately after a successful login. This was addressed by modifying `frontend-docusaurus/website/src/components/auth/Login.tsx`.

To verify this and all other authentication flow fixes, please follow the verification steps outlined in the previously created Prompt History Record (PHR ID: 37, path: `history/prompts/1-physical-ai-book/37-fix-authentication-flow.fix.prompt.md`):

1.  Start both the frontend and backend applications.
2.  Open your browser to the Docusaurus frontend.
3.  Log in with a registered user.

Upon successful login, you should be automatically redirected to `/docs/intro`. Please let me know if you encounter any issues during verification or if you have any further changes you'd like me to implement.
